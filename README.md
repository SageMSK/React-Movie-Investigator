# Movie Tracking App

## Getting Started

This project uses MongoDB. If you don't have MongoDB installed, you can check the link [HERE](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=homepage#community). You can also check the installation and setup [HERE](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/).

Once you have MongoDB set up, we can get started.

Install all the npm modules

> npm install

To start the app

> npm run dev

This will start both webpack for front-end and express backend server

If you wish to just start the express app (back-end) then just simply use

> npm run server
